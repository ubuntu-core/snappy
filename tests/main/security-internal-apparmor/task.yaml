summary: Check internal vendored apparmor in snapd snap

environment:
    AAP: /var/lib/snapd/apparmor/profiles/snap.test-snapd-setpriority.test-snapd-setpriority

prepare: |
    echo "Install a helper snap with default confinement"
    snap install test-snapd-setpriority

    echo "Enable installing the snapd snap, this happens automatically"
    snap set core experimental.snapd-snap=true
    # give the state time to create the change and then start watching
    # it
    retry -n 30 snap watch --last=transition-to-snapd-snap
    snap list snapd

    # TODO: the above doesn't actually install the snapd snap from this
    # branch though... we could repack the snapd deb into the snapd snap
    # and install that BUT the vendored/internal apparmor parser is only in
    # the snapd snap build *not* the deb, and so this does not help
    # either. So at the moment this test fails until this is merged into
    # master and so the vendored apparmor gets into the edge build of snapd
